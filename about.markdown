title: About
--------------

I'm a Computer Science student in University of Bath, going onto my third year.


This blog is where I'll publish any programming related musings I deem
interesting enough to share or talk about.

Over the summer of 2013 I will be posting updates about
[Haddock](http://www.haskell.org/haddock/), the
project I'm hacking on as part of Google Summer of Code.

The proposal being implemented can be seen
[here](https://gist.github.com/Fuuzetsu/81253ba7d0c51ac88052).
